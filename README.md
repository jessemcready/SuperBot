# SuperBot
Discord Bot that fetches champion information and Youtube videos

You need Python 3 in order to run the bot.  

How to run:

1) After cloning the repository to your computer, go onto https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro , navigate to "My Apps" on the left hand
 side and create a bot.  After the bot is registered, find the bot's token and place it in the quotes in the last line.
2) Once the token is added, use your python 3 system variable in the terminal and run main.py . 

If successful, you will see:
 Logged in as 
 "name of your bot" 
 "id of your bot" 
 -----

With the bot up and running, you can use it two ways:

1) !<champion name> <role> to get League of Legends champion information
2) .yt <video search terms> to get the first video that would appear on youtube when searching those terms.
